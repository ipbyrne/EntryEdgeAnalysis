# EntryEdgeAnalysis
This is an indicator template for MQL4 that measures the edge of a entry signal over time, providing a csv file that can be used to visualize the data in 6 different charts.


In the example below, we are measuring the entry of an MA system that looks at the slopes of the moving averages in order to view how the edge of this entry plays out over time. The top 3 charts do not factor in using any Stop Loss or Take Profit. The bottom 3 charts look at how the entry signal performs using a fixed Stop Loss and Take Profit, specifically analyzing the MFE/MAE data.
